                    <h3 align="left">Abstract</h3>
                    <p align="left">
			    Through our final project, our team set out to expand the functionality of pre-existing character models of IK rigs by introducing 
			    non-bipedal movement. We first learned about IK rigs as a type of procedural pose animation from Alexander Bereznyak's talk 
			    at GDC in 2016, and we were immediately intrigued by the efficiency and flexibility that was characteristic of IK rigs. After 
			    some research, we found that IK rigs employ inverse kinematics to do so, which effectively utilizes joints / pin bones to move 
			    neighboring structures instead of the classic parent-child hierarchy. Furthermore, it was unique for isolating the model from 
			    rig, such that the same rig could be applied to different models by adding custom rules; character could also be added to the 
			    model as needed. A key idea we sought to explore is the ability to linearly "add" these rules, such that a model could exhibit 
			    multiple traits in different poses. Effectively, we sought to be able to work towards two main objectives: to increase efficiency, 
			    in order to optimize the time and effort that is needed for game developers to implement variety in their models; and to enhance 
			    quality, in order to ensure that the animation and rigging of non-bipedal creatures can be done in a manner that is more reminiscent 
			    of real-life motion. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Technical Approach</h3>
                    <p align="left"> 
			    As our starting point, we utilized two open-source libraries from SketchPunk to serve as a baseline for the core aspects of bipedal 
			    movement, upon which we could explore and implement the functionality that is needed for non-bipedal movement to occur. The first 
			    library we referenced was Fungi, an open-source WebGL 2.0-based 3D character rendering and game engine. It was composed of multiple 
			    IK rigs and solvers that contain several key groups of creature body parts. We also utilized Ossos, which is an open-source 
			    web-based character animation and skinning library. It was composed of an armature system that that is built entirely around bones 
			    (not joints), and also has a prototype quadrupedal rig.
			    <br>
			    Our project can be broken down into three main tasks: the MVP, the quadruped, and the dolphin. For the MVP, we utilized the Fungi 
			    library to successfully rig a bi-pedal Pokemon called Mewtwo. For the quadruped, we optimized the process of quadruped rigging that was 
			    present in the Ossos library. Finally, for the dolphin, we re-targeted the entire animation sequence for a new creature body type.
