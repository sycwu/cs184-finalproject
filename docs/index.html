                    <h3 align="left">Introduction and Summary</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      Team Members: Amy Tran, Celeste Wu, Ivy Case, Rupa Duggirala
                      <br>
                      Inspired by Alexander Bereznyak's 2016 GDC talk on a type of procedural pose animation (IK rig), we wanted to expand
                      pre-existing open source code to also handle non-bipedal models. IK rigs boast efficiency and flexibility by employing inverse
                      kinematics, which uses joints/pin bones to move neighboring structures instead of the classical parent-child hierarchy.
                      It is further distinguished by isolating model from rig, such that the same rig can be applied to different models
                      by adding custom rules, as well as add character to the model if needed. A key idea to preserve is the ability to
                      linearly "add" these rules, such that a model can exhibit multiple traits in different poses.
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Problem Description</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      An early spark of the idea came from seeing Ekan's disappointing follow animation in Pokemon BDSP.
                      While we are uncertain as to why such a hilarious sliding coil passed quality checks, we started looking into challenges that
                      game developers often face when it comes to making models and rigs, especially when one is aiming for more variety in models.
                      Usually, more variety means more work, because now you have to account for how that body type runs / holds a gun / sits etc.
                      This time / effort barrier results in models in game with limited variety - or a questionable snake movement animation -
                      when developers cannot afford to manually rig each model. IK rigs hope to alleviate this issue by separating the model from the rig,
                      primarily by employing inverse kinematics in a manner that only features key joints that are likely applicable to models of a similar build.
                      By that, we mean bipedal vs. quadrapedal vs. legless etc. models.
                      <br>
                      In our search, we found open source code for IK rigs. We are hoping to expand it to non-bipedal creatures, which would entail
                      learning the source code, identifying key groups of creature body types, analyzing commonalities within each group, and finally
                      coming up with a synonymous framework as the pre-existing one for bipedal models. We are interested in seeing this implemented
                      because we would love to see our little snake friend move like a snake, but also because it is a fascinating idea to streamline the animation
                      pipeline for both animators and riggers alike. Finally, we think this will improve gameplay immersion if developers were to adopt this,
                      as we will start seeing more variety in game models without too much more cost and effort. Since none of our projects really touched on
                      animation and rigging, we are a little concerned with the steep learning curve, but we think it will be a rewarding experience.
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      (1) What we plan to deliver <br>
                      We hope to demonstrate our rigs and implementation by using 3D Pokemon models with a variety of body plans.
                      We envision them to be demonstrating a variety of movements, such as attacking, walking, going up stairs / down stairs and fainting.
                      Each group of body plans will have a few representatives to demonstrate how the rigs can be applied to different models.
                      We hope to qualify our work by how smooth and realistic the animation comes out to be. We also hope to demonstrate the efficiency by generating
                      an animated model bank for as many Pokemon models as we can find. <br>
                      (2) What we hope to deliver <br>
                      A second interest we had was to work with rig rules to make adjustable parameters that show the character / mood of the models.
                      We hope to be able to mimic the face rig demonstration of linearly adding key emotions (eg. sad + angry = betrayal)
                      and manifest these different ways of moving in our animations. Our goal is to generate an easy-to-understand interface
                      that allows artists and animators to easily tweak the characteristics. Perhaps this will look like sliders that are annotated
                      with the personality they represent (eg. energized, gloomy, lethargic etc.) As for our demonstration, we hope to again generate
                      animated sequences that show how differently a model can move once these rules are linearly added to the rig. <br>
                      At the end of the day, we hope to demonstrate how IK Rigs can spice up the game development scene and speed up the animation pipeline.
                      We will analyze this benefit both in terms of (1) increased efficiency and (2) the quality of the animations.

                    <p align="left">
                      In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
