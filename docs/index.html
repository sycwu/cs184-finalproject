                    <h3 align="left">Introduction and Summary</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      Team Members: Amy Tran, Celeste Wu, Ivy Case, Rupa Duggirala
                      <br>
                      Inspired by Alexander Bereznyak's 2016 GDC talk on a type of procedural pose animation (IK rig), we wanted to expand
                      pre-existing open source code to also handle non-bipedal models. IK rigs boast efficiency and flexibility by employing inverse
                      kinematics, which uses joints/pin bones to move neighboring structures instead of the classical parent-child hierarchy.
                      It is further distinguished by isolating model from rig, such that the same rig can be applied to different models
                      by adding custom rules, as well as add character to the model if needed. A key idea to preserve is the ability to
                      linearly "add" these rules, such that a model can exhibit multiple traits in different poses.
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Problem Description</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      An early spark of the idea came from seeing Ekan's disappointing follow animation in Pokemon BDSP.
                      While we are uncertain as to why such a hilarious sliding coil passed quality checks, we started looking into challenges that
                      game developers often face when it comes to making models and rigs, especially when one is aiming for more variety in models.
                      Usually, more variety means more work, because now you have to account for how that body type runs / holds a gun / sits etc.
                      This time / effort barrier results in models in game with limited variety - or a questionable snake movement animation -
                      when developers cannot afford to manually rig each model. IK rigs hope to alleviate this issue by separating the model from the rig,
                      primarily by employing inverse kinematics in a manner that only features key joints that are likely applicable to models of a similar build.
                      By that, we mean bipedal vs. quadrapedal vs. legless etc. models.
                      <br>
                      In our search, we found open source code for IK rigs. We are hoping to expand it to non-bipedal creatures, which would entail
                      learning the source code, identifying key groups of creature body types, analyzing commonalities within each group, and finally
                      coming up with a synonymous framework as the pre-existing one for bipedal models. We are interested in seeing this implemented
                      because we would love to see our little snake friend move like a snake, but also because it is a fascinating idea to streamline the animation
                      pipeline for both animators and riggers alike. Finally, we think this will improve gameplay immersion if developers were to adopt this,
                      as we will start seeing more variety in game models without too much more cost and effort. Since none of our projects really touched on
                      animation and rigging, we are a little concerned with the steep learning curve, but we think it will be a rewarding experience.
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Goals and Deliverables</h3>
                    <p align="left">
                      This is the most important part of your proposal. You should carefully think through what you are trying to accomplish, what results you are going for, and why you think you can accomplish those goals. For example:
                      Since this is a graphics class you will likely define the kind of images you will create (e.g. including a photo of a new lighting effect you will simulate).
                      If you are working on an interactive system, describe what demo you will create.
                      Define how you will measure the quality / performance of your system (e.g. graphs showing speedup, or quantifying accuracy). It may not be possible to define precise target metrics at this time, but we encourage you to try.
                      What questions do you plan to answer with your analysis?
                      You should break this section into two parts: (1) what you plan to deliver, and (2) what you hope to deliver. In (1), describe what you believe you must accomplish to have a successful project and achieve the grade you expect (i.e. your baseline plan -- planning for some unexpected problems would make sense). In (2), describe what you hope to achieve if things go well and you get ahead of schedule (your aspirational plan).
                      Schedule
                      In this section you should organize and plan the tasks and subtasks that your team will execute. Since presentations are ~4 weeks from the due-date of the proposal, you should include a set of tasks for every week.
                      Resources
                      List what resources, e.g. books, papers and/or online resources that are references for your project. List the computing platform, hardware and software resources that you will use for your project. You have a wide latitude here to use what you have access to, but be aware that you will have to support and trouble-shoot on your platform yourselves. If you are starting from an existing piece of code or system, describe and provide a pointer to it here.
                    </p>
