                    <h3 align="left">What We've Accomplished</h3>
                    <p align="left">
			    Through our final project, our team set out to expand the functionality of pre-existing models of IK rigs by introducing 
			    non-bipedal movement. Initially, we hoped to utilize <a href="https://github.com/06wj/pokemon">GLTF Pokemon models</a>, but we 
			    ultimately chose not to as the source code was not formatted in a manner that was easily conducive to future enhancements. 
			    Instead, we identified that we could employ <a href="https://www.google.com/url?
			    sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://github.com/KhronosGroup/COLLADA2GLTF&ved=2ahUKEwj56t3Pu7L3AhXCJkQIHcRoCE8QFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1Z
			    v88mkdj-6vdWEErbqjd0">KhronosGroup's COLLADA (.dae) to .gltf and .bin Converter</a>, for which we could make use of these <a href="https://www.models-resource.com/3ds/pokemonxy/">Pokemon models</a>. Our 
			    next task was to demonstrate that the IK rigs could be re-targeted; this was done by duplicating a provided demo.html file, as we 
			    ensured that it adequately provided us with a baseline to define the root and limbs / appendages of the Pokemon character models. However, 
			    in order to implement a broad range of non-bipedal movement, we found that we would need to add in bones that are defined by joint chains. 
			    To accomplish this, we downloaded the Blender software and learnt how to specifically make and edit bones; we also "skinned" the 
			    bones with vertex groups to form them into a more cohesive unit for re-targeting. 
			    <br>
			    By this point, we were able to form the core skeleton for our character models! However, we noticed that there was an issue with 
			    our GLTF file, as it didn't have a pose attribute. This meant that it would be difficult to increase the accuracy of our re-targeting 
			    code, especially if the target reference pose was vastly different from the source. We found that commenting out line 164 of the 
			    demo.html file allowed us to preserve the IK solution for the skeleton, but this inherently resulted in bugging out the mesh, 
			    as it's now flying in all directions and is not merely an overlay on top of the model's skeleton. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Preliminary Results</h3>
                    <p align="left">
			    Overall, we're really proud of our work on the final project so far! We were able to utilize our newfound knowledge of the Blender software 
			    to build out the skeleton of our character models. In order to be able to re-target these models and ultimately implement non-bipedal 
			    functionality, we created bones, compiled them together in joint-like structures, and "skinned" them into vertex groups to further ensure 
			    that they would move as a cohesive unit. We were also able to fix our initial issue with the pose attribute after a lot of troubleshooting, 
			    after we identified that it was due to an error with Blender exporting. We were able to solve this error by manually creating a pose attribute 
			    by using the rotation and translation attributes of the nodes of the trex and vegeta models as well. While we were able to make some initial 
			    progress with skinning the models, we're hoping to be able to look into a more efficient and correct way of representing this feature next, 
			    so that the mesh (as represented in our demo video) will no longer bug out and fly in all directions. 
			    <br>
			    We've linked a few <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15Lx5MikK2njUaLvOqi7eeQRLPR0JzwuGIcG2260tYBo/edit?usp=sharing">presentation slides</a>, 
			    which summarize our final project overall in addition to the current progress we've made.
			    <br>
			    We've also included a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4StiTYSEEs">milestone demo video</a>, which highlights what we've achieved so far. 
                    </p>
                    <h3 align="left">Progress on our Work Plan</h3>
                    <p align="left">
			    Reflecting upon our initial work plan, we found that we've been able to follow it relatively well. At this point on our initial schedule, we 
			    were hoping to be able to understand how to work with the new platform, finalize body plan categories and assignments, and set up a framework 
			    for each of them to ensure that we can readily attach them to models. Through our work on the Blender program over the past few weeks, we've 
			    been able to accomplish most of these tasks by building out the core bone skeleton for our character models. However, we still need to fix the 
			    aforementioned skinning issues before we can continue to work on the rest of our intended project tasks, so we've allocated extra time on our 
			    timeline to do so. After this point, we're hoping to be able to follow our schedule as intended to ultimately build out non-bipedal 
			    functionality on our character models.
			    <br>
			    This is the updated work plan we've created for ourselves, based on the progress we've made so far and what we still have left to finish. <br>
			    4/26 - 5/1: Fix issues related to skinning on the models. <br>
			    5/1 - 5/5: Continue to attach to models, generate rules and render animations. <br>
                      	    5/5: Final Presentation <br>
                            5/5 - 5/10: Spend the last few days polishing the project as needed and writing up the webpage. <br>
                            5/10: Final Submission
