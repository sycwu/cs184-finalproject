Changes
- Bone.pidx is no longer nullable. -1 is used to denote there is no parent
- Pose.getWorldTransform & getWorldRotation handles bIdx == -1 by returning Pose.offset value.
- SwingTwistSolver doesn't apply twist if pole direction is all zeros
- BoneSprings setRestPose has a parameter to not reset the current springs velocity and position.

Fixes
- Update the codebase to handle the Bone.pidx change.
- Bug in BoneSprings where reset is called, it was zeroing out the input data which caused issues.
